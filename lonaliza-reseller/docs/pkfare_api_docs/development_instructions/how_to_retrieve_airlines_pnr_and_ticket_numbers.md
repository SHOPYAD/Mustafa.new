# How to retrieve airlines\'PNR and ticket numbers

## 🎫 Ticket Number and PNR Mapping – Interface Parameter Explanation

This document describes how to parse and prioritize the ticketing and PNR data in the PKFARE-issued ticket push interface. It aims to help integrators accurately extract and associate ticket numbers with passengers and flight segments.

* * *

## ✈️ Data Source Prioritization

### ✅ Primary Source: `pnrList`

Always prioritize the `pnrList` structure when it is available. It provides the most **granular mapping** between:

*   Passengers (via `passengerIndex`)
*   Segments
*   Ticket numbers (`ticketNums`)
*   Airline PNRs (`airPnr`)

This ensures that each passenger and segment can be precisely linked with the correct ticket number and airline PNR.

### ❌ Ignore: `data.pnr`

The `data.pnr` field is an **order-level general PNR** and should be ignored during downstream processing, as it holds **no segment-level or passenger-level value**.

* * *

## 🔁 Fallback Logic (When `pnrList` is Missing)

If `pnrList` is not present or is empty, use the following fallback approach to extract ticket and PNR information.

### 🧾 Sample Fallback JSON

`{   "airPnr": "TODURR",   "passengers": [     {       "firstName": "Mark",       "lastName": "Zuo",       "ticketNum": "1234671234561/1234671234562"     }   ] }`

* * *

### 🔍 Parsing Rules

*   Extract `airPnr` from `data.airPnr` as the **order-level airline PNR**.
    
*   Extract ticket numbers from `data.passengers[].ticketNum`:
    
    *   Ticket numbers are joined by `/`, so split them accordingly:
        
        `["1234671234561", "1234671234562"]`
        
*   If no further mapping is available, assume the **ticket order matches journey segment order**.
    

* * *

## 💡 Best Practices

### ✅ Always use `pnrList` when available:

*   It’s the most **granular source** of ticket-to-passenger-to-segment mapping.
*   Includes both `ticketNums` and `airPnr` per segment.

### ❌ Ignore `data.pnr`:

*   It’s a **general order-level placeholder**.
*   Holds **no value** for passengers or segment-level processing.

### 🛠 Fallback when `pnrList` is missing:

*   Use `data.airPnr` as the **airline PNR**.
*   Use `data.passengers[].ticketNum`, and **split on `/`** if multiple tickets exist.
*   Ensure fallback mapping aligns with the **segment count or journey order**.

### 🔍 Data validation tips:

*   Confirm **ticket number format** is **13-digit**.
*   Ensure **ticket count matches journey segment count** (when using fallback).
*   Make sure each `ticketNum` is **properly associated** with the correct passenger and flight segment.
