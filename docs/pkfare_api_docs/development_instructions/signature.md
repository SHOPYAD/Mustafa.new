# Signature - PKFARE Flight Buyer API

All interface requests require a `sign` field to verify the identity of the requester. The signature needs to use the `partnerId` and `partnerKey` fields, and the method of signing is to calculate the MD5 value of the combination of these two fields. You can obtain the `partnerId` and `partnerKey` from your account manager.

For example, below is a code sample for generating the `sign` field in real-time within the Pre-request Script of Postman, using JavaScript:

`const partnerId = pm.environment.get("partnerId"); const partnerKey = pm.environment.get("partnerKey"); const sign = CryptoJS.MD5(partnerId + partnerKey).toString();`
